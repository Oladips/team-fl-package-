## Use this package as a library
Depend on it

Run this command:

With Flutter:

 ```
 $ flutter pub add authentication
 ```
This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit flutter pub get):

```
dependencies:
  authentication: ^0.0.1
```
Alternatively, your editor might support flutter pub get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

Import it
Now in your Dart code, you can use:
```
import 'package:authentication/authentication.dart';
```
